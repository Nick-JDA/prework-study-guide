        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information, or Metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the element.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for search engine optimization.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines Metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The scrypt element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the "children" is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>Tags are represented by angle brackets with associated tag names inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash.</li>
