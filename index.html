        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information, or Metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the element.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for search engine optimization.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines Metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The scrypt element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the "children" is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>Tags are represented by angle brackets with associated tag names inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page, it merely adds a buffer.</li>
          <li>The padding property indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger. That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element.</li>
          <li>To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes reffered to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>Do not Repeat Yourself code is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>Combining two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repitiion, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do not Repeat Yourself code.</li>
          <li>One way to center a title or heading on a webpage is using the text-align positioning property.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Adding CSS to HTML involves using the link element which creates a connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS; inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS involves styling an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. This is useful for quick and permanent changes but less flexible as each inline style must be edited individually.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This INTERNAL STYLE SHEET contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This method allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git commands always start with "git" and are used to save and track versions of code.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
