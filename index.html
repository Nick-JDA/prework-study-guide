        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information, or Metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the element.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for search engine optimization.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines Metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The scrypt element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the "children" is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>Tags are represented by angle brackets with associated tag names inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page, it merely adds a buffer.</li>
          <li>The padding property indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger. That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element.</li>
          <li>To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes reffered to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>Do not Repeat Yourself code is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>Combining two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repitiion, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do not Repeat Yourself code.</li>
          <li>One way to center a title or heading on a webpage is using the text-align positioning property.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Adding CSS to HTML involves using the link element which creates a connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS; inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS involves styling an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. This is useful for quick and permanent changes but less flexible as each inline style must be edited individually.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This INTERNAL STYLE SHEET contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This method allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that let's you manage and keep track of each version of your project. Git is accessed using the command line but unlike bash commands such as "cd" and "mkdir" Git commands always start with "git".</li>
          <li>git commands always start with "git" and are used to save and track versions of code.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git revert: "SHA/hash code" to revert to previous code build version when using version control systems.</li>
          <li>git add: moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.</li>
          <li>git commit: takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "[ Type in commit message]"</li>
          <li>git commit -a: commits any files you've added with the git add command and also commits any files you've changed since then.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: To check if local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub. "git" is keyword, "pull" is command to revieve branch's modifications in to local environment. "Origin" keyword indicates source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo, "main" keyword indicates the branch.</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: To push changes made to "feature/starter-code" we have locally to our remote Github branch.</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language. Using JavaScript you can power websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>JavaScript can take a static HTML/CSS webpage and make it interactive.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Variables are "containers" that store values.</li>
          <li>Variables can hold values that have different data types, like Strings, Numbers, Boolean values, Arrays, and Objects.</li>
          <li>A String is signified by enclosing it in single or double quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Numbers do not require quotes around them.</li>
          <li>A Boolean is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that do not require quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Arrays are structures that allow you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li>An Object can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable</li>
          <li>Operators are mathematical symbols that produce a result based on two values or "variables". Examples include Subtraction -, Multiplication *, Division /, Assignment =, Strict Equality ===, Not or Does-not-equal !, !==</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of this is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. If you see something which looks like a variable name , but it's followed by parentheses-()-it is likely a function. At the most basic level, a function is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Events or Event Handlers are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the "click event", which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse.</li>
          <li>for loops use the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Commenting out is the process of making code inactive without deleting it. To do this put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
